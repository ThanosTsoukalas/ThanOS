# ThanOS Desktop
ThanOS Desktop, as the name suggests, is an HTML Based Desktop environment with an SDK Built-in, so developers can develop their own custom apps using ThanOS's APIs. 
# Disclaimer 
This repository is just a demo. I'm looking forward to making a full Operating System Based on C and Assembly.
