# ThanOS 
ThanOS is an HTML-Based "Virtual Machine" with an SDK Built-in, so developers can develop their own custom apps using ThanOS's APIs. Its main use is for creating simple to use and cross-platform applications without the need of code in most cases. Since ThanOS is exactly the same across alloperating systems, the apps built for it will run exactly the same, no matter the device, and with no ads or any catch, since ThanOS is Open Source.
ThanOS is also a great development machine, since most developer tools are included right out of the box (Still in progress)

# This is a Hobby Project
This project first began as a hobby and taught me so much about programming and systems design (for frontend) in general. Because I was a beginner, however, large chunks of code in this project may not even make sense or have appropriate formatting. I apologize in advance for any confusions the source code might cause to more experienced programmers out there.
