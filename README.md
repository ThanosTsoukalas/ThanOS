# ThanOS 
ThanOS is an HTML-Based "Virtual Machine" with an SDK Built-in, so developers can develop their own custom apps using ThanOS's APIs. Its main use is for creating simple to use and cross-platform applications without the need of code in most cases. Since ThanOS is exactly the same across alloperating systems, the apps built for it will run exactly the same, no matter the device, and with no ads or any catch, since ThanOS is Open Source.

# Still in Beta
If you want to use ThanOS as a standalone product, I am sorry to inform you that this project is still in Beta, and will probably become stable in at least 6 months.
