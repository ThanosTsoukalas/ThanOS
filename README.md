# ThanOS Desktop
A few weeks ago, I made a Web Version of ThanOS. But it had problems. It didn't feel like a distinct Workspace. And it didn't even have the opportunity of supporting AAA Games. But now I made
a new version of ThanOS, based on Electron. So I can code it like a website, but the result feels like a native desktop app!
